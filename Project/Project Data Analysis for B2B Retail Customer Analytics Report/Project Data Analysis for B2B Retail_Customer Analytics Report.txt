 ##Memahami table
 SELECT * 
 FROM orders_1 limit 5;
 SELECT *
 FROM orders_2 limit 5;
 SELECT * 
 FROM customer limit 5;
 
 ##Total Penjualan dan Revenue pada Quarter-1 (Jan, Feb, Mar) dan Quarter-2 (Apr,Mei,Jun)
 SELECT SUM(quantity) as total_penjualan, SUM(quantity*priceeach) as revenue 
 FROM orders_1 WHERE status = 'Shipped';
 SELECT SUM(quantity) as total_penjualan, SUM(quantity*priceeach) as revenue 
 FROM orders_2 WHERE status = 'Shipped';
 
 ##Menghitung persentasi keseluruhan penjualan
 SELECT quarter, SUM(quantity) as total_penjualan, SUM(quantity*priceeach) as revenue 
 FROM (SELECT orderNumber, status, quantity, priceEach, "1" as quarter 
	   FROM orders_1 
	   UNION 
	   SELECT orderNumber, status, quantity, priceEach, "2" as quarter 
	   FROM orders_2) as tabel_a WHERE status = "Shipped"
 GROUP BY quarter;
 
 ##Apakah jumlah customers xyz.com semakin bertambah?
 SELECT quarter, COUNT(DISTINCT customerID) as total_customers
 FROM(SELECT customerID, createDate, QUARTER(createDate) as quarter
      FROM customer WHERE createDate
	  BETWEEN "2004-01-01" and "2004-06-30") as tabel_b
 GROUP BY quarter;
 
 ##Seberapa banyak customers tersebut yang sudah melakukan transaksi?
 SELECT quarter, COUNT(DISTINCT customerID) as total_customers
 FROM(SELECT customerID, createDate, QUARTER(createDate) as quarter 
	  FROM customer WHERE createDate BETWEEN "2004-01-01" and "2004-06-30") as tabel_b WHERE customerID IN(SELECT DISTINCT customerID 
	  FROM orders_1
	  UNION
	  SELECT DISTINCT customerID 
	  FROM orders_2)
 GROUP BY quarter;
 
 ##Category produk apa saja yang paling banyak di-order oleh customers di Quarter-2?
 SELECT * 
 FROM(SELECT categoryID, COUNT(DISTINCT orderNumber) as total_order, SUM(quantity) as total_penjualan
 FROM(SELECT productCode, orderNumber, quantity, status, LEFT(productCode, 3) as categoryID
 FROM orders_2 WHERE status = "Shipped") as tabel_c
 GROUP BY categoryID) as a
 ORDER BY total_order DESC;
 
 ##Seberapa banyak customers yang tetap aktif bertransaksi setelah transaksi pertamanya?
 --Menghitung total unik customers yang transaksi di quarter_1
 SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customerID) as total_customers FROM orders_1;
 #output = 25
 SELECT "1" as quarter, (COUNT(DISTINCT customerID)*100)/25 as Q2
 FROM orders_1 WHERE customerID IN(SELECT DISTINCT customerID FROM orders_2);
